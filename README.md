# KODI-Architectural-Analysis
This was a third-year research project where I was the project manager. We were tasked with analyzing the conceptual and concrete architecture of the open-source media center application known as KODI. We created research papers detailing our thoughts on requirement analysis, software engineering and the unforeseen outcomes of certain tech practices. We also created videos and powerpoints to illustrate our thoughts. Because KODI is a large, open-source program, we got experience using the Understand software in order to learn how to parse through a database with millions of lines of code. As we began to understand the internal architecture more and more, we were also tasked with learning how to improve it, all of which is documented in our research papers and presentations. 

Here are YouTube videos with group member Raksha Rehal walking through each presentation:
