# KODI-Architectural-Analysis
This was a third-year research project where I was the project manager. We were tasked with analyzing the conceptual and concrete architecture of the open-source media center application known as KODI. We created research papers detailing our thoughts on requirement analysis, software engineering and the unforeseen outcomes of certain tech practices. We also created videos and powerpoints to illustrate our thoughts. Because KODI is a large, open-source program, we got experience handling a database with millions of lines of code and worked towards both understanding it and learning how to improve it. 

Here are YouTube videos with group member Raksha Rehal walking through each presentation:
